    <h1>Networking 101 </h1>
          <p>Networking can be difficult especially for introverts.  It can be awkward and make you feel uncomfortable.  Stepping out of your comfort zone is challenging.  Meeting new people is hard at any age but can be more difficult for adults.  This is because adults tend to be stuck in their ways and already have a core group of friends.  As introvert and an INTJ, I know this challenge.</p>
      
          <p>However awkward it may be, networking is still an asset.  It is a chance to meet colleagues, find your next job or freelance opportunity and meet people who share your interests.  Here are some tips to help you achieve your networking goals.</p>
      
<!--          <p><b>Treat it like a normal conversation</b></p> -->
          <details><summary><b>Treat it like a normal conversation</b></summary><p>You don’t have to just stick to work topics and questions such as ‘What do you do?’.  Ask them how their day was, what books they have recently read, or what they enjoy doing in their spare time. Find a common interest.  You will be much more relaxed if you are talking about something you enjoy or are passionate about.</p></details>
      
          <p><b>Keep an open mind</b></p>
          <p>Just because someone isn’t a project manager or in leadership, doesn’t mean they’re not important.  Don’t write someone off because of how they are dressed or their job title.  Everyone as something to offer.</p>
      
          <p><b>Practice active listening</b></p>
          <p>Don’t prepare your next question or response in your mind, let the conversation flow freely by listening. Once they are done talking you can follow up with a question to find out more.</p>

          <p><b>Bring a friend </b></p>
          <p>Preferably one that is outgoing. They can give you the push you need to interact with your peers.</p>
      
          <p><b>Don’t attend a networking event in a bad mood</b></p>
          <p>Unless it is mandatory to attend, if you are not in the best mood or had terrible day it may be best to stay at home.  You want to go when you’re feeling great, optimistic, ready to meet new people. I tend to get grouchy when I am tired or hungry.  I try to eat something small before I engage with people at events, so that I am not hangry. If I’m tired and not in the mood to talk, I know it is best if I do not attend.</p>
      
          <p><b>Make eye contact</b></p>
          <p>Making eye contact is uncomfortable for some people.  Eye contact shows your interest.  It also displays confidence</p>
      
          <p><b>Prepare a list of topics to discuss</b></p>
          <p>Again, they do not have to professionally related. Just ways to engage people in conversation.</p>
      
          <p><b>Be yourself</b></p>
          <p>This is common sense, but still worth mentioning.  Do not try to be someone you are not.  Don’t pretend to like something that you don’t just to keep the conversation going.  If you have a different opinion it is okay.  Don’t be afraid to nerd out a little. If you enjoy talking about grammar or quantum physics, go for it.  People find it inspiring to see others discussing their passions.</p>
